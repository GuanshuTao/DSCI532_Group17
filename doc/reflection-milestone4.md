# Reflection of Milestone4

## Implementation

We completed and optimized our dashboard layout as well as the organization. We created a map figure which shows the mean of the ranking attribute and make it into a tab with the table. In addition, we added a scatter plot below the histogram tab which shows the spread and distribution of selected attributes. We also developed another histogram to express the relationship between the selected attribute and ranking. The map and histograms are only showing quantitative attributes.To make the dashboard organized, we put the dropdown boxes below the title and above the table. Furthermore, we added colors to our dashboard to make it attractive. 

We also wanted to improve our visualization view and styling by adding interesting football images on tables or charts, while it is time consuming for us to learn so we were not able to do that. There are a lot more attributes in the dataset than what we have used in the dashboard, but it is too complicated for the audience if we display all the attributes and lack of concentration on our purpose. 

## Thoughts on Feedback

The feedback we got was to the point and we implemented almost all of it in our dashboard. We got a lot of valuable feedback, for example adding a scatter plot and slider, and combining plots with tabs. Both TA and our peer suggested us to add colors and to make our dashboard more complicated. Our peer also suggested us to change the expression of numbers for the wage/value column and our TA suggested us to make fonts larger. Overall our dashboard has been easy to use upon those nice messages we received.
